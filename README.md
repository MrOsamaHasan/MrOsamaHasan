      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Osamah Hasan, IT professional with 5+ years of experience in IT operations, information security, and data analytics. I possess a strong background in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, planning, implementing, managing, administering, monitoring, and upgrading security measures, tools, platforms, and solutions for protecting internal users and customer data, systems, and networks.

I'm a collaborative team player with excellent interpersonal skills, able to work effectively in a multi-culture environment with cross-functional teams to resolve troubleshooting security and network problems. I'm also committed to continuous learning and professional development to stay up-to-date with the latest IT trends, tools, and technologies and continuously improve customer experience.

With a passion for cyber security and a diverse skill set that includes networking, cyber security, programming languages, databases, cloud and virtualization, I'm excited to pursue opportunities as a cyber security analyst.
  
I am passionate about protecting people and businesses from cyber attacks. I am always looking for new ways to improve the security of my clients.</p>
